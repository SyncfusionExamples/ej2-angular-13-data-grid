# Getting Started with Angular 13 Grid

The [Angular Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/angular-components/angular-grid?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-grid-github-samples), is a feature-rich data grid component for displaying data in a tabular format. Its wide range of functionalities includes data binding, editing, Excel-like filtering, custom sorting, grouping, row reordering, freezing rows and columns, aggregating rows, and exporting to Excel, CSV, and PDF formats.

## GridSample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Features and Benefits of Angular Grid Component

### High performance
The Angular Data Grid has optimized design for high-performance. Loads large volumes of data, nearly 1 million+ records, within one second without any performance degradation with the help of row and column virtualization.

### Data binding
Bind data seamlessly with various local and remote data sources such as JSON, OData, WCF, and RESTful web services. The data grid uses the data manager to handle data and supports customizing data requests and processing.

### Skeleton loading indicator
The Data Grid shows the Shimmer effect as a loading indicator while fetching data and binding it to the grid during initial rendering, refreshing, or after performing grid actions like sorting, filtering, grouping, and more. The Data Grid offers two types of loading indicator effect, spinner and shimmer.

### Column
Columns define the schema of data source in the Data Grid. It supports formatting, auto generating columns, column definitions, freezing rows and columns, column spanning, text wrapping, column chooser, column menu, and other features.

### Sorting
Sort rows either in the ascending or descending order against a column by simply clicking the header. Sort multiple columnsâ€™ data by holding Ctrl key + header click. In addition, define your own custom sorting logic based on the application needs.

### Filtering
Filtering helps view particular or related records in the Data Grid, which meet a given criteria. Data grid supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter. Choose appropriate filter type, define your own custom filtering logic, and customize the filtering UI based on the application needs. Diacritic characters can also be filtered.

### Selection
Select rows or cells either by using checkbox or by simply clicking them. Select more than one row or cell by holding Ctrl or Shift or Command, or programmatically.

### Editing
The Angular Data Grid supports create, read, update, and delete operations (CRUD). In addition to built-in editor components to edit a particular column value, custom editor components can be created according to the application needs using templates.

### Grouping
Group rows to display the data in an organized hierarchical structure either in the ascending or descending order to facilitate easier expansion and collapse of records. There is an option to group records of the desired column by simple drag and drop of that column in an interactive drop area.

### Aggregation
Easily visualize the aggregates of the Data Grid column values using the summary option. Aggregates can be customized to show their value in individual summary rows, individual group summary rows, or in group caption rows.

### Frozen rows and columns
Frozen rows and columns are visible at the top and left or right or both the sides of the grid and make the remaining grid content scrollable. It is mainly used to compare cell values.

### Stacked headers
Stacked headers allow grouping and visualizing column headers in a stacked manner. There is no limit to the number of columns that can be stacked.

### Localization
Based on their needs, users can localize all the strings used in the user interface of the Angular Data Grid component. Uses the localization (l10n) library to localize UI strings.
